# Server (Placeholder)

This directory contains a placeholder container setup for the future FastAPI backend. The current `Dockerfile` builds a minimal Python 3.11 image that verifies Python and prints a simple message. No frameworks or dependencies are installed yet. See `docs/architecture.md` for the monorepo and backend architecture direction.
