# Client (Placeholder)

This directory hosts placeholder container definitions for the future Flutter client targeting web and mobile. `Dockerfile.web` uses a tiny Nginx image to serve a placeholder page; `Dockerfile.mobile` is a minimal Alpine image to validate build pipelines without heavy toolchains. Refer to `docs/architecture.md` for the client architecture and roadmap.
